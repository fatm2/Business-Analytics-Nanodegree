This repository contains my projects for [Udacity's Business Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098) Nanodegree Program. This Udacity program aims to develop foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries. To Analyze data using `Excel`, query a database using `SQL` and build interactive dashboards and visualizations in `Tableau`. The main objectives for this nanodegree are to gain foundational data skills that are applicable to any industry. Collect and analyze data, model business scenarios, and communicate your findings with SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 


## Part 1: Introduction to Data Analysis


> In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard about Malaria in Africa to uncover insights. Then I wrote a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

- ## Part 2: Introduction to Data
> In this project, I've used statistics and spreadsheet programs (Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. In particular, I created a Profit & Loss statement with an S&P 500 company selector widget in Excel. I also used Excel to create a dynamic income statement, where I forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of choice from the NYSE dataset. Lastly, I analyzed the change in terms of Cost-of-good-sold between Year 1 and Year 3 for Materials Sector.

  ## Part 3: SQL for Data Analysis


> In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.

## Part 4: Data Visualization

> In this project, I built interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. I used a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more.
